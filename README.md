# Oil-colour-mix

Oils are amongst the most versatile types of paint and have been used to produce world famous works of art, such as Van Gough's Starry Night and Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. 

However, mixing realistic colours can be a big challenge, particularly for beginners. Many paint sets package unusual combinations of colours and even a pure looking blue or red can turn out to contain a little yellow or black. This means that trying to mix a simple colour, such as sky blue (blue+white), can be deceptive and end up looking more purple than expected! 

This simple app aims to give an idea of what you are mixing, so that you don't accidentally create and unexpected colour. It uses CMYK colouring to replicate the subtractive mixing of oil paint and chart.js to btoh display the fraction of colours included and calculate the mixture between them. Adjust the fractions in the paint mix with the sliders and add your own colours to the palette with the HTML form. CMYK breakdowns of many common oil paint pigments are available online, or you could use a CMYK colour picker to approximately replicate the colour of your paint by eye.
