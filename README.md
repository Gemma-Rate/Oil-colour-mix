# Oil-colour-mix

Oils are amongst the most versatile types of paint and have been used to produce world famous works of art, such as Van Gogh's Starry Night and Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. 

However, mixing realistic colours can be a big challenge, particularly for beginners. Even a strong blue or red can turn out to contain a little yellow, or black. This means that trying to mix even a basic colour, such as light blue (blue+white), can be difficult! 

This simple app aims to give an idea of what you are mixing, so that you don't accidentally create an unexpected colour. It uses CMYK colouring to replicate the subtractive mixing of oil paint and chart.js to both display the fraction of colours included and calculate the mixture between them. Adjust the fractions in the paint mix with the sliders or add your own colours to the palette via the HTML form. CMYK breakdowns of many common oil paint pigments are available online, or you could use a CMYK colour picker to approximately replicate the colour of your paint by eye.
